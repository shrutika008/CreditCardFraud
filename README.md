# Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! 
This project focuses on developing a robust system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine-learning techniques. Credit card fraud is a serious concern in the financial industry, and this project aims to provide a solution to help financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent activities.

# Introduction
Credit card fraud is a type of financial crime that involves unauthorized and fraudulent transactions made using stolen credit card information. The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions with a high level of accuracy. By doing so, it contributes to the security and trust in financial transactions.
